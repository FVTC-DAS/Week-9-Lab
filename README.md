# Week 9 Lab — Working with Dictionaries (Python)

**Goal:** Practice creating and working with dictionaries, including accessing, modifying, and iterating over key–value pairs.

## What you will do
- **Task 1:** Create a `movie` dictionary and access values.
- **Task 2:** Modify and add key–value pairs in the same dictionary.
- **Task 3:** Create a `class_roster` list of dictionaries and iterate with a `for` loop using f-strings.

## Getting started
1. Open this repository in VS Code.
2. Open **`week9_lab.ipynb`** and complete all TODOs in each task cell.
3. Run cells as you go and inspect outputs.

## Files
- `week9_lab.ipynb` — your main work. Complete all TODOs.
- `.gitignore` — ignores notebook checkpoints and OS cruft.

## Grading (Blackboard Rubric Summary)
**Criteria:** Completion  
- **Complete (5 pts):** A genuine attempt is made to solve all three tasks.  
- **Incomplete (0 pts):** Submission is empty, off-topic, or shows no genuine effort.

## Submission
1. Finish all cells in `week9_lab.ipynb`.
2. Use **Source Control** in VS Code to stage and commit with a message like:
   ```
   feat: Complete Week 9 lab
   ```
3. **Sync/Push** your changes. Your last pushed commit in GitHub Classroom counts as your submission.

### Troubleshooting
- If a cell won’t run, restart the kernel and run cells from the top.
- If variables look wrong, re-run the earlier task cells to reset state.
